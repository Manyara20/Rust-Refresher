**Install Rust using the following command:**

Incase you are stuck checkout the Rust Official Documentation
https://www.rust-lang.org/learn

**Cargo: the Rust build tool and package manager**
When you install Rustup youâ€™ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:

build your project with **_cargo build_**
run your project with **_cargo run_**
test your project with **_cargo test_**
build documentation for your project with **_cargo doc_**
publish a library to crates.io with **_cargo publish_
**
To test that you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run this in your terminal of choice:
_cargo --version_
